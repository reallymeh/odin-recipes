        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Hainan Chicken Rice is a classic dish beloved by people in Singapore and all over Asia. Served room temperature, the chicken is incredibly silky. 
            But the rice is really the starâ€”cooked in the broth from poaching the chicken, served with a trio of condiments.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 fresh or organic chicken</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                <li>12-14 cups water</li>
                <li>4-5 slices ginger</li>
                <li>2 whole scallions</li>
                <li>Ice</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash the chicken clean and remember to set aside the piece of chicken fat at the back cavity. Transfer the chicken to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel.
                     Lightly rub the chicken with the salt. This will give the chicken skin a nice sheen. Set it aside.</li>
                <li>Bring the water, along with the ginger and scallions, to a boil in a large stockpot. Before adding the chicken to the pot, rinse the chicken under 
                    running water to wash away the salt. Carefully lower the chicken into the boiling water, positioning the chicken breast-side up. Now is a good time 
                    to adjust the water level so the chicken breast just pokes above the water (so you aren't left with dry white meat).</li>
                <li>Once the water boils, carefully lift the chicken out of the water to pour out the colder water that is trapped in the cavity. 
                    Carefully lower the chicken back into the pot. Bring the water to a boil again, and cover the lid. Turn off the heat, and leave the pot covered 
                    on the stove for 45-50 minutes (set a timer). To check if the chicken is done, stick a toothpick into the thickest part of the drumstick. If the 
                    juices run clear, it's cooked through.</li>
                <li>When the 45-minute timer (for the chicken) is almost up, prepare a large ice bath. Once the chicken is cooked, carefully lift the chicken out of the pot, 
                    drain the water from the cavity and lower it into the ice bath. Take care not to break the skin. After 15 minutes in the ice bath, the chicken should be 
                    cooled completely, drain and cover with clear plastic until ready to cut and serve. The ice bath stops the cooking process, locks in the juices, and gives 
                    the chicken skin better texture.</li>
            </ol>
