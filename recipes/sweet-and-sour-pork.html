        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This sweet and sour pork recipe is from my husband's grandmother, who was Chinese. 
            She taught me how to make this recipe â€” it's the way Gramma made sweet and sour dishes her whole life until she died at age 94. The secret is apple cider vinegar.</p>
